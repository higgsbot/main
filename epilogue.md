# Epilogues

## IOIIIO
I had a lot of fun writing this project. It was something to do in my first week of holidays. I haven’t worked much in teams before on projects, so it was a new experience, but I liked it.

I learned a lot of new things (right before we started writing I discovered git submodules, so of course I wanted those included), and even managed to mostly maintain a healthy sleep schedule during the project. As I am writing this epilogue it is 6 am on a Saturday after an allnighter, so take from that what you will. I won't admit how much time I wasted on dataset. It's so simple, that it managed to confuse me, so kuddos to the creator for that. I'd recommend it.

We were not able to accomplish all our goals, but that doesn’t matter, the bot still came out great.

It was great working with my friends on this, and I am starting to ramble, so I should probably go make some coffee or something.

Hope you enjoy the bot!

This bot isn't the most polished or complete project I've ever done, but it certainly was an improvement for me in certain ways outside the tech.

I'm starting to become much more interested and engaging more multi-person projects, for the past few years I've only ever been doing solo projects. I also learnt that doing a hack-a-thon type project, moving into a new flat, and starting a full time job all in the same week doesn't really work out too well, haha. It's also the first time I've actually commited to starting a new project in quite awhile.

This is a project I've wanted to work on for a long time, and I'd like to continue it outside the hack-a-thon context when I have more time to do so. I find the idea of being able to share code and command executions over Discord to be quite interesting, especially as me and my friends are all hobbyist (or professional, but mostly hobbyist) developers/system administrators.

Thanks for checking out the bot, or at least reading these little epilogues. I always find the writing engineers of a project make after said project, whenever they do. I should maybe get some sleep now, I have more furniture arriving tomorrow and I need to be awake for getting and building it!
