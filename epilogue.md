# Epilogues

## IOIIIO
I had a lot of fun writing this project. It was something to do in my first week of holidays. I haven’t worked much in teams before on projects, so it was a new experience, but I liked it.

I learned a lot of new things (right before we started writing I discovered git submodules, so of course I wanted those included), and even managed to mostly maintain a healthy sleep schedule during the project. As I am writing this epilogue it is 6 am on a Saturday after an allnighter, so take from that what you will. I won't admit how much time I wasted on dataset. It's so simple, that it managed to confuse me, so kuddos to the creator for that. I'd recommend it.

We were not able to accomplish all our goals, but that doesn’t matter, the bot still came out great.

It was great working with my friends on this, and I am starting to ramble, so I should probably go make some coffee or something.

Hope you enjoy the bot!
