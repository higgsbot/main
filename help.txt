Welcome to Higgsbot
This help text file, along with the bot itself, is a WIP.

Commands

code: takes in code, does some magic, and poof.
Usage: higgs code [CodeTokens to use] [language in all lower case] [code]
You can start a new line, and use that fancy three ` code box, the bot takes care of that

hello: hello world
Usage: higgs hello

help: shows this help.txt file
Usage: higgs help

codetoken: does codetokeny stuff.
Usage: higgs codetoken [check/add] [integer amount of CodeTokens to add]
A rudimentary anti-abuse mechanism is in place that limits the amount of tokens to 10.
Until priviledge checks are added, this will be used. Sorry!
